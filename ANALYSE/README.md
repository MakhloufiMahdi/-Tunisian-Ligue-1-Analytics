# Player Stats

## 1. Top Scorers
 Hazem Mastouri and Firas Chaouat (14 goals each), Youssef Snana (13), Yan Sasse (10).

- There is a concentration of offensive performance around 4 dominant players.  
- The difference between the first (14) and the fourth (10) is small, which indicates a balanced competition for the top scorer title.  
- This may indicate a league where several clubs have effective scorers, instead of an extreme dependence on a single star.  
- There is an increase compared to the previous year.  
- A simple remark: there are three true strikers in the league, while Yan Sasse, who is EspÃ©ranceâ€™s top scorer, is not a striker. This shows that EspÃ©rance suffers from a lack of a true finisher.

## 2. Top Assisters

Best: Ahmed Mazhoud (6 assists), Chiheb JbÃ©li (6), Raki Aouani (4), Salaheddine Ghedamsi (4).

- The top assisters do not exceed 6 assists, a relatively low figure.  
- This shows low overall creativity or that goals are often scored from individual actions.  
- Compared to European standards, the contribution of assisters remains limited â†’ potential tactical improvement area.

## 3. Most Yellow Cards

Youcef BelaÃ¯li (9 cards), Ghaith Ben Hassine (9), Presnel Arnau (9).

- Three players reach the high threshold of 9 warnings, revealing fragile discipline.  
- These players negatively influence their teams (possible suspensions, penalties in key matches).  
- This may reflect a more aggressive style of play or difficulty managing pressure.

# Team Stats

## Goals Scored by Team

EspÃ©rance Tunis dominates (57 goals), followed by Ã‰toile du Sahel (46) and US Monastir (42).

- EspÃ©rance is clearly above with a +11 goal difference over the 2nd â†’ the most prolific attack.  
- This nevertheless confirms the quality of its offensive players.  
- Mid-table teams (30â€“37 goals) remain quite close â†’ sign of a competitive league.  
- Possible correlation with the final ranking (the best attacks are often at the top of the table).  


## Clean Sheets

- US Monastir clearly dominates the defensive sector with 20 clean sheets, confirming its reputation as an extremely organized and disciplined team.  
- Club Africain follows with 17 clean sheets, proof of a solid and well-structured defense, despite offensive limits.  
- EspÃ©rance Tunis, with 15 clean sheets, remains effective but does not reach US Monastirâ€™s level â†’ its superiority comes more from its attack than from its backline.  
- CS Sfaxien and AS Soliman (14 clean sheets each) show a respectable defensive profile, but without being dominant.  

ðŸ‘‰ the defensive ranking shows that the title does not depend only on the best attack. US Monastir, with an iron defense, reduces the number of lost matches. EspÃ©rance, on the other hand, compensates for a less airtight defense with an extraordinary offensive power.

  - EspÃ©rance lost only 2 times â†’ extreme stability.  
  - Ã‰toile fell 7 times â†’ fragility against some opponents.  
- US Monastir shows great consistency with 17 wins and only 2 losses, confirming its profile as a serious rival to EspÃ©rance.  
- Club Africain (15 wins, 6 losses) suffers from inconsistency: good ability to win but too many slip-ups.  
- ES Zarzis (16 wins, 8 losses) positions itself as an outsider, but its many losses limit its potential.  

ðŸ‘‰ The EspÃ©ranceâ€“US Monastir duo dominates through consistency (few losses).  
- Ã‰toile du Sahel, although having as many wins as EspÃ©rance, loses too often, preventing it from competing for the title.  
- Club Africain and Zarzis remain serious challengers but less consistent.

# Strategic Interpretation 

- EspÃ©rance Tunis remains the natural favorite thanks to its attack/defense balance and consistency (19 wins, only 2 losses).  
- US Monastir is the best defensive block and the most serious competitor to EspÃ©rance. If they strengthen their attack, they can claim the title.  
- Club Africain has a solid defensive base but lacks offensive power and consistency.  
- Ã‰toile du Sahel is the most spectacular but also the least stable team, oscillating between high-level performances and avoidable defeats.  
- ES Zarzis remains a brave outsider but limited by too much inconsistency.
