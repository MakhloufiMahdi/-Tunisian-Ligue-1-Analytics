## Fair-Play
3 players dominate the ranking with 10 cards each: Iheb Ben Amor (AS Gabès), Ghaith Ben Hassine (JS Omrane), Youcef Belaïli (Espérance Tunis).

Jean-Cedrik Gbo (ESS) is 4th with 9 cards (but 3 reds!).

Several players follow with 8 cards (Presnel Banga, Nassim Chachia, Fourat Soltani, Firas Sekkouhi).

Belaïli is the only one to reach 10 cards with yellows only → aggressive player but not sent off.

Key offensive player → accumulation of cards = risk of suspension → direct impact on the attack.

Jean-Cedrik Gbo has fewer total cards but more reds, which means serious fouls.

Having so many reds shows a profile of “aggressive / serious fouls” → puts the team at a numerical disadvantage.

These players can be considered “disciplinary risks” for their clubs.

## Ranking of teams by offensive efficiency

US Monastir has the best ratio (3.82) → for every goal conceded, they score almost 4.

Espérance Tunis follows (2.59), prolific attack (57 goals, best attack).

Etoile du Sahel and Club Africain remain solid (1.84 and 1.79).

CS Sfaxien (1.58) and Stade Tunisien (1.50) are still positive but less dominant.

A ratio > 2 means a very balanced team (good attack + good defense).

Espérance has the best raw attack (57 goals) but Monastir has the best relative efficiency since they conceded very few goals (only 11).
## Best attack & best defense

Espérance is the most offensive team in the league.

US Monastir has the best defense.

This confirms that the two clubs are the most dominant but with different profiles:

Espérance → offensive style.

Monastir → defensive discipline.

## Points per game

Espérance: 2.20 points/game (champion pace → >2 points/game).

US Monastir: 2.07 points/game.

ESS: 2.03 points/game.

Club Africain and ES Zarzis: 1.80 points/game → “continental qualification” level but not champion.

2 pts/game = champion’s pace.

Espérance shows the strongest consistency.

Monastir and ESS remain in the race but are slightly behind.
## Best player by team (ROW_NUMBER)

US Monastir & ESS: heavily depend on their stars (Mastouri, Chaouat) → Risk: if injury/suspension occurs, the team loses its main weapon.

Espérance: their top scorer has 10 goals, but the team scores 57 in total → involvement of several players → diversified attack = less dependence.

Club Africain: top scorer has only 6 goals → shows the team scores little, but in a distributed way → balanced, but lacks “killer instinct.”

## Player efficiency ratio

Youssef Snana (ES Zarzis) → 81.25% of his team’s goals (almost solely responsible).

Ahmed Hadhri (JS Omrane) → 70%.

Houcine Mansour (AS Gabès) and Amanallah Mjahed (AS Soliman) → ~57%.

Firas Sekkouhi (CS Sfaxien) → 55.56%.

Some teams rely heavily on a key player (Zarzis → Snana). If that player is absent, the team loses almost all its offensive power.

CS Sfaxien and AS Gabès → high offensive dependence but less extreme.

This allows us to measure a club’s tactical dependence on a star.
